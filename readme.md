This is the code for a 5 wheel, 3 visible tiles per wheel slot machine game. The machine is implemented in a series of functions, each of which is designed to deal with various aspects of the game. The important feature from a game design perspective is that the "distribution of tiles on a wheel" and "payouts per tile", and "win shapes" are each independent arrays, enabling complete customisation of these to obtain a desired payout. The ones provided here are not mathematically tested, beyond the authors intuition.
